    <p>Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place, and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it.</p>

    <p>You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep mocing forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!</p>
    
    <p> Now if you know what you're worht, then go and get waht you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wannan be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!</p>
